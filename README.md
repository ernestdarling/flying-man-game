# The Flying Man Game

## Overview
This game allows a user to fly through obstacles from top and bottom by using up and down arrow keys. User remains stationary while the obstacles streak through the page from right to left. With the user in the middle of the frame, this creates the illusion that the user is flying through the obstacles. Using wins after the game countsdown to zero without running into any obstacles.
